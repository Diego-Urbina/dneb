The positions given represent our best\n                    estimates of these values. Where possible, these are based\n                    on the ACRS and PPM data, with proper motion incorporated.\n                                                                                \nColumns  11- 17:    The discoverer, identified by his one-to-three letter code,\n                    and his discoverer's number, if assigned. The reference list\n                    should be consulted first to identify individuals. However, \n                    some discoverer designations do not appear in this list, for\n                    various reasons, and a supplementary list is provided.\n                                                                                \nColumns  18- 22:    Components, when the object has more than two. The Lick IDS\n                    scheme has been discontinued, and components are now\n                    referred to by the traditionally employed lower-case \n                    letters. The rather awkward upper-case designations, e.g. \n                    ABXC, have been changed to the form AB-C, etc. We have noted\n                    some confusion on the part of observers and students alike,\n                    as to how to designate components in multiple systems. \n                    Traditionally, these have been designated in order of \n                    separation, thus AB, AC,...., or in the cases where close \n                    pairs are observed blended, AB-C, AB-D,.... In some \n                    instances, differing resolution limits produce situations\n                    where observations are intermixed, thus AC, AB-C, and so\n                    forth (in all too many cases, carelessness on the part of\n                    the observer does not permit us to determine with certainty\n                    how the observation is to be interpreted). There are also\n                    many instances where later observations have revealed a\n                    closer companion; these are designated Aa, Bb, etc. In a few\n                    cases wider, later discoveries have also been so denoted.\n         \nColumns  24- 27:    The dates of the first and last observations of an object\n         29- 32:    (of satisfactory accuracy), up to the present date.\n                                                                               \nColumns  34- 37:    The number of measures of the object. \n                                                                                \nColumns  39- 41:    Position angles in degrees for the dates listed in columns\n         43- 45:    26-34. Crude positions (e.g., NP) of the past have been\n                    changed to their degree equivalent with an accompanying note\n                    in the data line of the measurement database. Position \n                    angles are unprecessed in this catalog (i.e., they are for \n                    the mean date of observation).                       \n                                                                                \nColumns  47- 51:    The distances in seconds of arc, and tenths, for the dates\n         53- 57:    listed in columns 26-34. Some separations are treated by the\n                    codes found in columns 100-101, or in the Notes.\n                                                                                \nColumns  59- 63:    Magnitudes of the two components. See the Introduction for\n         65- 69:    discussion.\n                                                                                \nColumns  71- 79:    Spectral type of A, or of two components, if space permits.\n                    See the Introduction for discussion.\n                                                                               \nColumns  81- 84:    The components of the proper motion in seconds of arc per\n         85- 88:    1000 years, in right ascension reduced to great circle, and\n                    in declination. Specifically, this catalog lists 15mu(alpha)\n                    cos(delta), where mu(alpha) is in seconds of time, and     \n                    mu(delta) is in seconds of arc. Both quantities are reduced\n                    to a time unit of 1000 years. The exceptions are those \n                    objects coded P for which an explanation is given under the\n                    description for Columns 108 to 111. + and - indicate \n                    eastward and westward motions in Right Ascension, and + and\n                    - those north and south in Declination. Where possible, this \n                    comes from Tycho-2.\n\nColumns  90- 93:    Proper motion of the secondary, when known.\n         94- 97:    \n\n                                                                               \nColumns  99-106:    Durchmusterung number of the object in the system used by\n                    the Henry Draper Catalogue: Bonn from +89 degrees to -22\n                    degrees inclusive, Cordoba from -23 degrees to -51 degrees\n                    inclusive, Cape Photographic from -52 degrees to -89 \n                    degrees inclusive. When a star is not contained in the \n                    Durchmusterung proper to its declination zone, but is \n                    contained in another Durchmusterung, this is so indicated \n                    in the Notes. Other components having different \n                    Durchmusterung numbers are also indicated in the Notes.\n                                                                                \nColumns 108-111:    The following codes are contained in these columns:\n\n                        N: Notes found in the Notes table.                     \n                        B: Summary line gives blue (Johnson U or B, blue\n                           photographic, etc.) magnitudes\n                        C: Orbit and Linear solution. A published orbit exists\n                           and this system has a Linear Solution as well. A \"C\"\n                           code, then, indicates both an \"O\" and an \"L\" code.\n                        D: Has measure in Delta-M catalog\n                        I: Identification uncertain. Match of object at precise\n                           position with WDS pair may or may not be correct.\n                           Currently under examination.\n                        K: Summary line gives K-band or other infrared (>1\n                           micron) magnitudes         \n                        L: Linear solution.

This pair may\n                           represent a positional typo in the original publication\n                           (so we're looking in the wrong location), an optical\n                           double disappearing due to radically different proper\n                           motions, a plate flaw, or simply a pair not at a\n                           magnitude, separation, etc., sufficiently similar to \n                           those noted when the first measure was added (making\n                           it too faint, too close, etc.).

The other codes can \n                    occur in any column.\n                                                                              \nColumns 113-130:    The hours, minutes, seconds and tenths of seconds (when\n                    known) of Right Ascension for 2000, followed by the degrees,\n                    minutes, and seconds of Declination for 2000, with + and - \n                    indicating north and south declinations. The positions given\n                    represent our best estimates of these values. Where \n                    possible, these are based on the Hipparcos and Tycho data, \n                    with proper motion incorporated. While the arcminute \n                    coordinate (columns 1-10) refer to the primary of a multiple\n                    system, the arcsecond coordinate (columns 113-130) refer to\n                    the primary of the subsystem. For example, while the BC pair\n                    of an A-BC multiple will have the same 10 digit WDS \n                    coordinate, the arcsecond coordinate of the BC pair will be\n                    at the \"B\" position.\n");
